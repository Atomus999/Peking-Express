In this project I worked with a classmate to create a game-like application based on the reality show Peking Express. We were provided a text file which contained information to create a graph that would represent the locations we could visit and the paths between them as well as some other details and constraints . We would also start from any possible vertex and would have to reach the ending in the shortest possible time. 
We built the game to be played in turns and the algorithm would find the most efficient path to the ending that was withing our possible budget, all while considering the locations of other players and if those locations were occupied. 
The application was build in Java but it could have been build in other languages such as C# because the important part was the mapping and the written algorithm
